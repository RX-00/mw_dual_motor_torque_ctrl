This documentation describes the **mw_dual_motor_torque_ctrl** firmware for the
`Open Robot Actuator Motor Boards`_ using comunication via CAN.

This firmware allows torque control of two motors at once using communication
via CAN.  Use this firmware when you want to connect a TI LaunchPad evaluation
board or a BLMC ÂµDriver board via CAN.  If you want to communicate via Ethernet,
using a Master Board, use the udriver_firmware_ instead.

This program can be used with the Universal Dual Motor GUI.
